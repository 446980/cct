              My name is Mitchell, I was born at the Collingwood General Marine
              Hospital on November 10th, 2003. I currently live in the Town of
              the Blue Mountains. I have a sister named grace, and my parent’s
              names are Richard and Sandra. We have a dog named Sadie, a rabbit
              named Presley and 9 chickens. Some of my hobbies include playing,
              building and collecting guitars. I own 7 guitars as of now, I own
              3 acoustics, 3 electrics and one electric bass. I also enjoy
              working on my 1975 Dart Sport, working in my workshop and fixing
              things around the house. Recently we have bought a new gas tank, a
              new seat and a radio for the Dart Sport. During the summer we
              replaced the radiator hoses, the oil filter, the gas filter, and
              were able to get it to idle. Some sports and activities that I
              enjoy are swimming, and fishing. Another club that I participate
              in is the Robotics Club.

              Through grade six to grade eight I was in the coding club at St.
              Marys. In the coding club I learned scratch, x code and a little
              bit of Java. In the summer after grade eight I taught myself a bit
              of HTML while using notepad as my editor. I currently own a
              Raspberry Pi 3 but have not begun to teach myself how to code with
              it yet. I am very interested in robotics and computer programming.
              I also like remote controlled vehicles and FPV drones. Last year I
              competed on the Skills Canada robotics team, we had to design and
              build a robot that would be able to shoot foam balls into a net on
              the feild and a net on the other team’s robot. We faced many
              challenges while building the robot such as how to pick the balls
              up, load them, and how to shoot them fast enough to make it across
              the field.
